What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Needed because it is what git uses to store the data.
Git init allows git to start controlling that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area = area where changes can be made before committing them to the repository.
Allows for less commits, instead of committing with each little change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change? 
It allows you to test your code before committing. Also allows you to compare files of the most recent commit.

When would you want to create a new branch, and when would you not
Create: When your making a new version/ feature, maybe experimenting with other programmers. When multiple programmers are working on a project.
Not Create: ? Have to come back to

How do the diagrams help you visualize these changes?
They make it easy to see the flow of the branch


What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Merging results in a commit between both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually? 
Pros: Multiple parties (again!)
Con: Maybe one part of merged code conflicts with another (Broken code).
