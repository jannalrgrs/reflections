When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever there's multiple collaborators, when you want to share work with others. Or if you forget/ lose your own computer


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
All are used to add new changes without altering the existing version (ex. Larry’s recipes).

Forking : only able to fork to another github repository from github.
Branching: used to keep another version
cloning: only works on local repositories, including files from github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? 
Knowing the last remote allows you merge the latest version with your local branch, then you can push it back to Github’s remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
