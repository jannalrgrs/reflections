How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allows the user to spot differences quickly, instead of looking through one file then the other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows more experimentations, programmers are as afraid of losing code. Allows the ability to look back on code in the case a bug was introduce

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does? 
Pros: Won't interrupt code (saving in the middle of a line). Able to specify each change
Con: Some users could forget, human error. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one cmmit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git users need to edit multiple files at once, whereas GoogleDocs users usually are only in one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? - Git log can be used for whole file; git diff allows for comparison of two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? - If something breaks, version control allows you to go back to the older version to fix whatever it was.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? - GitHub.
